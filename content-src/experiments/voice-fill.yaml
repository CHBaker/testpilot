  Speech recognition comes to Firefox. Voice fill lets you speak to your favorite search engines.
introduction: >
  <p>Voice Fill uses artificial intelligence to interpret speech input. As a participant in the Voice Fill experiment in Test Pilot, your voice searches will teach our AI to provide smarter results.</p>
  <p>We've added Voice Fill to Google, Yahoo and DuckDuckGo search pages, and will expand to more sites as the experiment progresses.</p>
